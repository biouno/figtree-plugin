# Jenkins FigTree Plugin

This plug-in integrates Jenkins and FigTree.

FigTree is designed as a graphical viewer of phylogenetic trees and as a 
program for producing publication-ready figures. As with most of my programs, 
it was written for my own needs so may not be as polished and feature-complete 
as a commercial program. In particular it is designed to display summarized 
and annotated trees produced by BEAST.

## Basic structure

The plug-in consists of a Notifier, which is run after the build completed. It 
uses its configuration and looks for trees generated by MrBayes, BEAST or other 
tools. 

You can use an Ant-like pattern for the tree files (**/*.tree means look for 
any file ending with the extension .tree in this directory and all 
subdirectories).

The plug-in executes FigTree specifying the output as Gif graphic. The image 
of the tree is ready to be used in academic papers, and is displayed to the 
user in the Build view. It means that if you executed the job, and it ran 
Build #3, you can click on the Build link and it will have your graphic 
there as an image. 

You can also see the console logs, open the workspace to check the files 
present in the workspace, or simply right click on your image and use it in 
your paper.
